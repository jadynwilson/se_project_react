## Plan on improving the project

I would like to add to the website to have more functionality. I would like to be able to add my own clothing into the app. Also being able to add more filters including, colors, brands, type of clothing item. Eventually I hope to be able to change the profile information and images.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
